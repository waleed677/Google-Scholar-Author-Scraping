# Google-Scholar-Author-Scraping
I scraped the google scholar author's data using Python Scrapy Framework. This repository has anti scraping techniques which will allow you to scrap the data without blocking the IP.
There is one file in this repository fields.txt which contains the fields related to research. This file is used to scrape the author data related to these files so you can put fields as much as you can in this file.
In setting.py file you can change the Download_Delay to any value , but i will recommend you to make it 3-5 sec so that your IP address never gets block.
